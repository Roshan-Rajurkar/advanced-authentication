# advanced-authentication
Streamline MERN stack projects by prioritizing the early development of login and registration pages, along with backend routes for authentication, to enhance efficiency and save time. You can use this in your application to focus on the main features of the application.
## Getting Started

### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the client application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The client will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Server

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install server dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Project Structure

- **Client:** Frontend code resides here.
- **Server:** Backend code, API routes, and authentication logic.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure MongoDB is properly configured and running for the server to connect to the database.

- Customize the client and server code to suit your project requirements.

Now you're ready to begin developing your MERN stack project!
