# advanced-authentication

Streamline M-E-R-N stack projects by prioritizing the early development of login and registration pages, along with backend routes for authentication, to enhance efficiency and save time. You can use this in your application to focus on the main features of the application.

## Getting Started

### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the client application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The client will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Server

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```
   cd server
   ```

2. Install server dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Project Structure

- **Client:** Frontend code resides here.
- **Server:** Backend code, API routes, and authentication logic.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure MongoDB is properly configured and running for the server to connect to the database.

- Customize the client and server code to suit your project requirements.

Now you're ready to begin developing your MERN stack project!
